Project Summary
Title:
AI-Assisted Automated Deployment of ML Models and Dynamic Pricing Strategy for GlobalMart
Objective:
Develop a production-ready, end-to-end machine learning pipeline that enables GlobalMart to implement a dynamic pricing strategy for its Tide detergent brand. The solution will analyze sales, competitor pricing, customer behavior, and inventory data to optimize pricing decisions, maximize revenue, and balance demand with inventory efficiency. The project will leverage AI-assisted coding tools such as GitHub Copilot to ensure best practices in automation, modular coding, deployment, monitoring, testing, and continuous retraining on Azure ML Managed Endpoints.

Implementation Plan
Phase 1:
Complete ML model development lifecycle including data preprocessing, feature engineering, model selection, hyperparameter tuning, and validation with MLflow integration.
Phase 2:
Automate deployment of trained regression/classification models to Azure ML Managed Endpoints with comprehensive logging and error handling.
Phase 3:
Implement a robust testing framework including smoke, unit, and integration tests covering the ML pipeline and deployment.
Phase 4:
Build monitoring and logging infrastructure with drift detection, alerting, and model performance tracking.
Phase 5:
Develop automated retraining pipelines triggered by monitoring alerts or scheduled intervals, incorporating champion-challenger model strategies.
Phase 6:
Create a CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions for end-to-end automation of testing, deployment, and retraining workflows.
Phase 7:
Develop a responsive web application backend and frontend (Streamlit or React) to provide batch prediction capabilities via Azure ML Managed Endpoints.
